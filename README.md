# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Title: IPL Player Comparison Dashboard

Description:
Developed a dynamic and interactive web application to compare IPL players' statistics using React.js. The project leverages modern web development tools and libraries to provide a seamless user experience for cricket enthusiasts. The application allows users to select teams and players, view their detailed statistics, and compare their performance side-by-side.

Key Features:

Player Comparison Interface:

Users can select two players from the same team and compare their statistics, such as matches played, runs scored, batting average, strike rate, wickets taken, and more.
The comparison is displayed in a visually appealing grid format.
Team and Player Selection:

Dropdown menus for selecting teams and players, implemented using reusable React components like Select.
Data Management:

Player data is stored in a structured JSON file (data.json), which includes detailed statistics for players across all IPL teams.
Responsive Design:

Styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure the application is responsive and visually consistent across devices.
Performance Monitoring:

Integrated web-vitals to measure and monitor the app's performance metrics.
Build and Deployment:

Configured with Create React App and enhanced using CRACO for custom configurations.
Supports production builds optimized for performance.
Technologies Used:

Frontend Framework: React.js (with hooks for state management)
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Build Tool: Create React App (CRA) with CRACO for custom configurations
Testing: React Testing Library and Jest
Performance Monitoring: Web Vitals
Version Control: Git
